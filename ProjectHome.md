# TopCat #

TopCat is a free and open source rich web application template to be used in either commercial or non-commercial projects.

The tamplate may be used to make a rich and appealing web application's UI, a website's admin UI or something completely different.

_TopCat is currently in it's first development, so there's no working version availible._

## TopCat's objectives ##

TopCat's objectives are very clear: TopCat aims to be a rich, fast and functional template for web applications and admin zones of various websites.

There is a very large selection of such templates, that can be bought from various sites ([Themeforest](http://themeforest.net) and similar), but there are very few availible for free or even as open source.

With TopCat we will finally get a template like this for free and as open source.

First TopCat's development objective is to (almost) completely replicate an existing template, made by [Łukasz Girek (Rzepak)](http://themeforest.net/user/rzepak), named [AdminTheme](http://themeforest.net/item/admintheme-ultimate-admin-panel-solution/45278).

[AdminTheme](http://themeforest.net/item/admintheme-ultimate-admin-panel-solution/45278) was even offered for free on [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net) in September 2009 ([read the post](http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/free-file-of-the-month-september-2009)), but with some restrictions:

> _"You are granted ONE free usage of the item in a project either commercial or non-commercial. You may not use the file in multiple projects unless you purchase licenses in the usual way. You may not redistribute the item in any way. If you need a different license for this file, you may purchase it here (link)."_ From themeforest.net.

This was a very generous gift from AdminTheme's author Rzepak, but unfortunately has some restrictions. For this reason TopCat project was created.

## The project's name ##
